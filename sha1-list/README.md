# Muse Sounds SHA1 List

This folder contains the SHA1 list of the original Muse Sounds library. The list is used to check the updated files in the library.

Besides, in many cases, Muse Hub seems do not check the integrity of downloaded soundfonts, so I think it would also be convenient to check the integrity by running the scripts below and view differences of this folder.

This folder is generated like this (Please fill in folder paths before running, generated by ChatGPT and Verified by Scilxurkel):

```python
import os
import hashlib

def compute_sha1(file_path):
    sha1 = hashlib.sha1()
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        while chunk := file.read(8192):
            sha1.update(chunk)
    return sha1.hexdigest()

def read_checksum_file(checksum_file_path):
    checksum_dict = {}
    with open(checksum_file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            parts = line.strip().split('  ', 1)  # Split using double spaces as delimiter
            if len(parts) == 2:
                sha1_value, relative_path = parts
                checksum_dict[relative_path] = sha1_value
    return checksum_dict

def verify_files_in_folder(folder_path, checksum_dict):
    for root, _, files in os.walk(folder_path):
        for file_name in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file_name)
            # Compute relative path to match with checksum file entries
            relative_path = os.path.relpath(file_path, folder_path)
            if os.path.isfile(file_path):
                computed_sha1 = compute_sha1(file_path)
                expected_sha1 = checksum_dict.get(relative_path)
                if expected_sha1:
                    if computed_sha1 == expected_sha1:
                        print(f"The SHA-1 value matches for {relative_path}!")
                    else:
                        print(f"The SHA-1 value does not match for {relative_path}!")
                        print(f"Computed SHA-1: {computed_sha1}")
                        print(f"Expected SHA-1: {expected_sha1}")
                else:
                    print(f"No expected SHA-1 value provided for {relative_path}")

# Example usage
folder_path = 'MuseSounds/Muse Hub Instruments (Your Muse Sounds Library)'
checksum_file_path = '(Project Folder)/sha1-list/checksum.txt'

checksum_dict = read_checksum_file(checksum_file_path)
verify_files_in_folder(folder_path, checksum_dict)
```
